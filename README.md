# Ball Tracking Using OpenCV

This project demonstrates real-time ball tracking using OpenCV. The script identifies and tracks a green-colored ball in a video stream or from a webcam feed. The tracked ball's position is highlighted, and its trajectory is displayed as a green trail.

## Features

- Detects and tracks a green object in real-time.
- Highlights the tracked object with a bounding rectangle and center point.
- Displays the object's trajectory using a fading trail effect.

## Requirements

Ensure the following are installed before running the script:

- Python 3.7+
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- imutils

Install the required libraries using:

```bash
pip install opencv-python imutils numpy
